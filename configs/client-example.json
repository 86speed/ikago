// The IkaGo-client configured in this example will connect to IkaGo-server at server:18081 from random port and send
// data from the client to the server with MTU 1400. At startup, IkaGo-server will configure firewall
// rules (recommended), and log to client.log. IkaGo-client will proxy all supported traffic with source address
// 10.6.0.2 or 10.6.0.3, and it will respond to ARP requests to 10.6.0.1. Also, IkaGo-client will host monitoring
// services on port 18080. Via http://ikago.ikas.ink, you can see the network traffic information of IkaGo-client.
// On the device being proxied, you should set the IP address to 10.6.0.2 or 10.6.0.3 and the gateway to 10.6.0.1.
